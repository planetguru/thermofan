# thermofan

This Heath Robinson style project turns the [Ecofan](http://www.ecofan.co.uk/woodstove-ecofans.html) into the world's most complicated thermometer.

The ecofan has a thermocouple which can induce sufficient current to drive a fan for the purpose of moving air around the room. 

Find an old greeting card, cut out a small tab and sellotape it to the end of one of the fan blades, then assemble a rotary wheel encoder, interfaced with the GPIO pins of a raspbery pi. Lo! and behold, you have the hardware required for a thermofan assembly.

Plug in this python script and change the web-service details so that you aren't uploading your temperatures to my web site.. and then we're all in Heath Robinson log-burning heaven.

Hurrah!

Next step - a little mobile app to beep at the wife when a new log is required.  Next weekend..
